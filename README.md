# 🕶️ Blind Auction Simulator (Python Project)

This project is a simple **Blind Auction Simulator** written in Python, inspired by one of the early projects in the **"100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp"** by **Dr. Angela Yu**.

It's a terminal-based program that allows multiple users to place bids in secret. At the end of the auction, the highest bidder and their bid amount are displayed.

## 📚 About the Project

As part of my learning journey in Python, I started the **100 Days of Code** bootcamp by Angela Yu. This blind auction project was one of the first coding exercises where I applied concepts like:

- Variables and user input
- Dictionaries
- Loops and conditional statements
- Functions and modular code design
- Console-based interaction
